This is the project at the company where I did my voluntary internship.

I communicated with the device by applying the TCP/IP communication protocol. For this operation I used nmodbus, which is the .NET package used for IoT. I transferred the data in the registers of the device with which I communicated to the MS SQL server database I created. To see the datas, i prepared interface with Windows Forms. I also checked the electricity at the relay of device inputs by sending a command to the device with which I was communicating. I made all the implementations in C#.
